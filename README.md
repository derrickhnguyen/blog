## Why

I like getting my feet wet with new libraries and frameworks. After the people over at [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) launched Prisma 2.0, I knew I had to give it a shot since I personally found Prisma 1.0 great. In addition, I stumbed across "Code-First" development with GraphQL after purchasing and reading [Marc-Andre Giroux](https://twitter.com/__xuorig__?lang=en)'s book [Production Ready GraphQL](https://book.productionreadygraphql.com/). I'm fairly proficient in creating GraphQL APIs, but have only done "Schema-First" development. Creating "Blog" was a way for me to explore new technologies that I rarely get to touch in my day to day job!
